Device abstract
---------------

An instance of a `Device` class represents the physical device or sample to be
tuned. Rather than being a collection of instruments and instrument parameters,
it should be thought of as a container keeping track of the dot-initialization
process. Beside lists of gates and ohmics, a `Device` contains information
about how it should be read out (readout_methods dictionary) and how gates
are arranged (device_type string). For the hard-coded tuning logic approach,
knowledge about the gate layout is required and specified as a list of gate
names, sorted by the order they appear on the sample. Supported device
layouts are defined in the configuration file, e.g. "doubledot_2D":
["top_barrier", "left_barrier", "left_plunger", "central_barrier",
"right_plunger", "right_barrier"].
The class also has a convenience methods manipulating all gates collectively,
which are used for initialization, resetting and normalization constant
measurements. Normalization constants, a `Device` parameter, need to be
measured before a measurement by recording the noise floor and open device
signal, e.g. max current when all gates are at their highest allowed voltages.
They are required for data normalization before fitting and classification.

A `DeviceChannel` is a wrapper around a voltage parameter of a DAC channel with added
tuning functionalities. It contains attributes keeping track in which range
each gate is expected to be 'active' (current_valid_range), at which voltage
it is expected to pinch off (transition_voltage), the maximum voltage jump
supported (max_jump), to be used to calculate safe setpoints if not ramping),
and whether it should be ramped and ramping is supported by hardware.
New voltages are ramped to if specified by the use_ramp parameter, either
using a hardware ramp or QCoDeS' software ramps specified by inter_delay.
The layout_id parameter is the gate's index in the device layout list.
